# so_long
It's a very simple game written in C language as a part of 42 Heilbronn core curriculum. 
To launch the game you have to install brew and glfw at first.

If you have brew you can do so by simply typing "make install" in a terminal.
If you don't have brew, please install brew first.

Once you have them installed you can compile the game with "make".

To launch the game you have to open the executable "so_long" with a valid path to the map as a second parameter. 
(e.g. "./so_long maps/map1.ber")
There're some default maps in the maps folder, but you can always modify them or create new ones, without the need to recompile the game.
